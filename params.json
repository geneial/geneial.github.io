{"name":"Geneial.GitHub.io","tagline":"Geneial Website","body":"GeneiAL is an open source extensible [genetic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) library. It provides a framework to solve optimization problems by maximizing fitness value of the chromosomes in a population over the course of generations using a custom fitness function.\r\nThe library offers the user high flexibility and extensibility while simultaneously featuring good scalability for the core functionality.\r\n\r\n## Installation and Documentation\r\nPlease, follow our installation guide to install the library on your system and run the demos.\r\nA doxygen-generated documentation can be found here.\r\n\r\n## Implemented Features\r\n* support for user-defined chromosome types (e.g., the optimization of sequences of genes)\r\n* generation of new chromosomes using random values within a user-specified interval\r\n* generation of new chromosomes by partially/fully reusing population from a previous optimization\r\n* multi-threading support for the evaluation of the fitness function\r\n* diagnostic tools to analyze the genetic algorithm's behavior (i.e., runtime measurement, analysis of genetic operators, etc.)\r\n* extendible by user-specified analysis tools with customized pre- and post-processing logic\r\n\r\n### Genetic Operators\r\n* roulette-wheel selection\r\n* N-point crossover, smoothed variant of N-point crossover\r\n* uniform mutation, smoothed variant of uniform mutation\r\n* extendible by customized genetic operators\r\n\r\n### Stopping Criteria\r\n* basic stopping criteria (_fixed-point-criterion_,_maximal number of generations_, etc.)\r\n* extendible by user-defined stopping criteria\r\n* support for a combinations (AND, OR, XOR, Negation) of multiple stopping criteria","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
